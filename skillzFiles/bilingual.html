<h2>I am fluent in Spanish</h2>

<p> Not only was my major in college Spanish, but I have experience in professional settings with both reading and writing and even real-time translation. I also have experience with coworkers from all walks of the latin american world, so I know a thing or too about the colloquial language. </p>
