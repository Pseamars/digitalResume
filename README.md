This is my Digital Resume 


I am diving into the world of web development and this is my first project. I aim to demonstrate my abilities while also showcasing my resume. Here is a list of features I am looking to add: 

- A header with my name and then my Twitter profile pic eases in to fill in the spot between first and last. 

- Single page nav and parrallax scrolling a la Kapitall home page

- An animated goal/mission statement

- A timeline  that then animate to a lightbox with details:

- Skills badges that change text description above on click 

- A Development stack Pie-chart of proficiency

** Just for fun: a section that illustrates my interests and activities that would include 

  - a bicycle that scrolls across the screen via parrallax and 

  - a random image generator that when a button is clicked, generates an image with text about my interests and activities.
